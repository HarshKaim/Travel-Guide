# Travel-Guide
Suppose you want to visit some famous sites in a city. You want to visit it in short duration of time.
To make it work here we used Kruskalâ€™s algorithm for proper route planning
Here we are providing user 4 cities with list of places to visit.
After that user will be asked to select a city and  choose his/her favourite places from list and he/she will get a route with minimum total distance
